## 2026-03-28: price_change fallback over-engineering

**What happened:**
Item 9 (fix `_get_price_change` dependency on normalized_trades) was implemented with 3 chained queries:
1. Query flow_bars_1m to find nearest bar
2. Query normalized_trades within that bar's time window
3. Fallback to delta/volume estimation

Step 1→2 was pointless — querying normalized_trades scoped to a flow_bar window is the same as querying it directly. This tripled the DB load per snapshot for no benefit.

**Root cause:**
Jumped to a "clever" solution without thinking about whether the intermediate step added value. flow_bars_1m doesn't store price, so using it as an index to find normalized_trades was a round-trip to nowhere.

**Correct approach:**
1. Try normalized_trades first (works for events < 3 days, same as original)
2. Only if no data, fallback to delta/volume ratio from flow_bars_1m

**Rule:** When adding a fallback path, ask: "Does this intermediate step give me information I don't already have?" If not, skip it. Prefer the simplest query chain that solves the problem. Don't add queries that increase Railway DB usage without clear value.

## 2026-03-29: delta/volume ratio ≠ price change

**What happened:**
`_get_price_change()` fallback used `total_delta / total_vol * 100` when normalized_trades had no data. This produced values like +4.84% that looked like real price moves but were actually the **taker imbalance ratio** (what % of volume was net buy).

**Root cause:**
Confused two different metrics. delta/volume ratio measures buy-sell pressure, not price movement. The two are correlated but not interchangeable — especially on short windows where slippage is minimal.

**Correct approach:**
Return None when normalized_trades has no data. Don't fabricate price estimates from flow data.
